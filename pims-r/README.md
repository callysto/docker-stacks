# pims-r

This is our R flavoured notebook, it builds on pims-minimal adding  from anaconda

## Updates

If the minor version of R is updated (e.g. from 3.3 to 3.4) the localPkgDir
variable in RProfile.site should be updated accordingly. This is the location
that will be used for local package installations
